# 📘 Data Science Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Data Science Learning Repository**!  
This is where I document my journey as I explore and practice core concepts of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis. Every day, I upload notebooks and code that reflect what I’ve learned — from foundational topics to real-world hands-on exercises.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository is a **work-in-progress learning log** that includes:
- 📚 Concepts I’m currently studying  
- 🧪 Daily hands-on coding and experiments  
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis using real datasets  
- 🛠️ Implementation of key tools and techniques in Python  

I use this space to build understanding by doing, not just reading. It’s messy, evolving, and real — just like the learning process itself.
