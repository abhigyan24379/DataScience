    "- what is feature creation?\n",
    "    - feature creation involves deriving new, meaningful features from existing ones to enhance a model's ability to capture important patterns in the data \n",
    "- examples of feature creation \n",
    "    - date time feature \n",
    "    - interaction features\n",
    "    - aggregations\n",
    "- importance\n",
    "    - adds domain knowledge to the dataset\n",
    "    - captures hidden patterns and trends not evident in the original features \n",
    "### Transforming features \n",
    "- what is feature transformation ?\n",
    "    - feature transformation modifies existing features to better suit the learning algorithm ( this is especially important for handling skewed distribution or non linear relationship)\n",
    "- common transformation\n",
    "    - logarithmic transformation \n",
    "        - which reduces skewness in highly skewed distribution \n",
    "    - squared Root Transformation \n",
    "        - moderately reduce skewness often used for count data \n",
    "    - Polynomial transformation \n",
    "        - adds higher order terms(x^2, x^3) to capturre non linear relationship \n",
    "- importance\n",
    "    - enhances the model's ability to fit non linear relationship \n",
    "    - makes distribution more normal like aiding algorithm that assume normality \n",
    "### Importance of feature transformation in non linear relationship \n",
    "- Transformation allow linear model to handle non linear realtionship \n",
    "    - for example \n",
    "        - polynomial transformation enable linear regression to model quadratic patterns \n",
    "        - logarithmic transformation stablize variance and handle skewness \n",
    "- By transforming features models become more robust and capable of capturing complex pattern in data "
